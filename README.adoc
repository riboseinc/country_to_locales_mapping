= Country to locales mapping

Provides a mapping between ISO3166 country codes and RFC4646 locale
codes. Locale codes are placed in order of usage in the region
(e.g. de-CH > fr-CH > it-CH).

It is distributed as a Ruby gem.

Country-Locale data is stored in: `data/country_locale_map.json`.
RFC4646 Locale codes are ordered to indicate preference.
i.e. locale code in column 3 is more important than the locale code
in column 5 for a country.

First Locale code always reflects the official language of country
(but might not be only official language, e.g. CH).
